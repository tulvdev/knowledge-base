# Contributing (personal)

## Note template
Use this structure unless the topic requires otherwise:

- Context
- Key ideas
- Example(s)
- Pitfalls / anti-patterns
- References

## Markdown style
- Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Prefer fenced code blocks with language tags.
- Keep lines reasonably short for diff readability.

## Tags
Use a short tag line near the top when useful, e.g.
`Tags: #kafka #spring-kafka #retry #dlt`
